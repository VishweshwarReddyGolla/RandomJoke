# RandomJoke

😂 Random Joke Generator
This is a simple web application that displays a random joke each time you click the "Get New Joke" button.
It uses JavaScript's async/await and the fetch API to retrieve jokes from a public API.

🚀 Features
Fetches a random joke from the API: https://apis.ccbp.in/jokes/random

Uses async/await for clean asynchronous code.

Handles API errors gracefully.

Simple, clean, and responsive UI with basic HTML & CSS.
